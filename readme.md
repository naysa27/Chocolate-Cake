As an Egg-Free Chocolate Cake Recipe:
To make the cake an egg-free chocolate cake recipe, Iâ€™ve used 2/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the 2 large eggs in the recipe. You will note that you may have to bake the cake just a few minutes more. Be sure to check with the skewer for doneness.

This Chocolate Cake Is:
Extra moist
2 layers, but can be made as 3 layers or as a sheet cake
Soft with a velvety crumb
Deeply flavorful
Unapologetically rich, just like my flourless chocolate cake
Covered with creamy chocolate buttercream
